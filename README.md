# Friends App

This website is my first project learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails; I also used Bootstrap, which I find it to be a magnificent tool. This website is a functional CRUD website, which means it can Create, Read, Update, and Delete!

I plan on learning more about Ruby and Ruby on Rails in the future!

To see the website and its functions working, clone the repository and run "rails s".
